# Recipe Website to showcase basic HTML and CSS

[Live Website](https://aaronsww.github.io/odinRecipes/)

## Project Summary
 I have put together 3 food recipes that are directly inspired by some of my favourite anime in the form of this website. I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, links and work with lists. Alongside, I gained an understanding of web design and had fun playing around with color palettes. The recipes themselves are borrowed but however, the design layout was compiled by myself.
