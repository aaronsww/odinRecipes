            - Howl's Moving Castle (ハウルの動く城)</a
          >
        </h1>
        Teenager Sophie works in her late father's hat shop in a humdrum town,
        but things get interesting when she's transformed into an elderly woman.
        Howl’s Moving Castle is one of my favorite Ghibli films. The breakfast
        scene is probably one of the most popular food scenes out of all the
        Ghibli films, or even anime in general. While it’s a very simple Western
        breakfast, the animation just looks so divine while they’re cooking and
        eating it.

            - Weathering with You (天気の子)
          </a>
        </h1>
        Set during a period of exceptionally rainy weather, high-school boy
        Hodaka Morishima runs away from his troubled rural home to Tokyo and
        befriends an orphan girl who can manipulate the weather. In the film,
        there is a scene where Hina prepares a series of creative dishes for
        Hodaka. They include potato chip fried rice paired with some instant
        ramen salad.

            - Your Name (君の名は)
          </a>
        </h1>
        Your Name is a love story with a swoony romantic affinity for the
        age-old tussle between chance and fate. Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school
        girl, yearns to live the life of a boy in the bustling city of Tokyo—a
        dream that stands in stark contrast to her present life in the
        countryside. Meanwhile in the city, Taki Tachibana lives a busy life as
        a high school student while juggling his part-time job and hopes for a
        future in architecture. On his expedition to find Mitshuha, weary Taki
        finds himself in a restaurant that serves him Shoyu Miso Ramen.
